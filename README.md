#**Fraud Detection in Ethereum Cryptocurrency Transactions**
---
## **Overview**
This project detects fraudulent transactions on the Ethereum blockchain using Machine Learning. Ethereum, as a decentralized blockchain platform, facilitates millions of transactions daily. However, its anonymity and lack of central regulation make it susceptible to fraudulent activities such as money laundering, phishing, and Ponzi schemes. This project aims to detect fraudulent transactions in Ethereum using machine learning techniques.
